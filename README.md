# OepIntegrator

_Serves as a integration facade for open-E Platform. Provides a way to interact with Open-E platform via REST instead of
SOAP._

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Java 21 or higher**
- **Maven**
- **MariaDB**
- **Git**
- **[Dependent Microservices](#dependencies)**

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sundsvallskommun/api-service-oep-integrator.git
   cd api-service-oep-integrator
   ```
2. **Configure the application:**

   Before running the application, you need to set up configuration settings.
   See [Configuration](#Configuration)

   **Note:** Ensure all required configurations are set; otherwise, the application may fail to start.

3. **Ensure dependent services are running:**

   If this microservice depends on other services, make sure they are up and accessible.
   See [Dependencies](#dependencies) for more details.

4. **Build and run the application:**

   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

## Dependencies

This microservice depends on the following services:

- **Party**
  - **Purpose:** For translating partyId to legalId.
  - **Repository:** [Party](https://github.com/Sundsvallskommun/api-service-party)
  - **Setup Instructions:** Refer to its documentation for installation and configuration steps.

Ensure that these services are running and properly configured before starting this microservice.

## API Documentation

Access the API documentation via Swagger UI:

- **Swagger UI:** [http://localhost:8080/api-docs](http://localhost:8080/api-docs)

Alternatively, refer to the `openapi.yml` file located in the project's root directory for the OpenAPI specification.

## Usage

### API Endpoints

Refer to the [API Documentation](#api-documentation) for detailed information on available endpoints.

### Example Request

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/resource
```

## Configuration

Configuration is crucial for the application to run successfully. Ensure all necessary settings are configured in
`application.yml`.

### Key Configuration Parameters

- **Server Port:**

  ```yaml
  server:
    port: 8080
  ```
- **Database Settings:**

  ```yaml
  spring:
    datasource:
      url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database
      username: your_db_username
      password: your_db_password
  ```
- **External Service URLs:**

  ```yaml
  integration:
    party:
      url: http://dependency_service_url
      oauth2:
        client-id: some-client-id
        client-secret: some-client-secret

  party:
    oauth2:
      token-url: http://dependecy_service_token_url

  properties:
    credentials:     
        secret-key: your-super-secret-key   # Used to encrypt passwords
  ```

### Configure Open-e Instances

The application is able to handle multiple Open-e instances. These are not configure in the application.yml file, but in the database. The best way to do this is to use the API to create the instances. Refer to the [API Documentation](#api-documentation) for more details.

### Database Initialization

The project is set up with [Flyway](https://github.com/flyway/flyway) for database migrations. Flyway is disabled by
default so you will have to enable it to automatically populate the database schema upon application startup.

```yaml
spring:
  flyway:
    enabled: true
```

- **No additional setup is required** for database initialization, as long as the database connection settings are
  correctly configured.

### Additional Notes

- **Application Profiles:**

  Use Spring profiles (`dev`, `prod`, etc.) to manage different configurations for different environments.

- **Logging Configuration:**

  Adjust logging levels if necessary.
